Extension
In the base application, various health factors are analyzed using machine learning models to predict cardiovascular disease risk. This includes features like age, gender, cholesterol levels, and smoking habits. The models used include ensemble methods such as Random Forest, K-Nearest Neighbors, Support Vector Machines, Decision Trees, AdaBoost, and XGBoost.
